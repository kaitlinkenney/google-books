# Google Books Search

## Overview

* A React-based Google Books Search app. Uses Node, Express and MongoDB.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to browse for books, but I want to organize my favorite books in one place
so I can revisit them later.

## Description

Allows users to search for a book, and view results from the Google Books API. Users can then view the book on the Google Books website, or save it for later on their customizable "saved books" list.
Users are free to visit their list of saved books to once again view any book on the Google Books
website, or they may delete any book from their list.
